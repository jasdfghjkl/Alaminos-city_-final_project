                <h1>HON. JAN MARIONNE R. FONTELERA</h1>
                <img src="images/VMJanMarionneRF.jpg" class="mayor-img"> 
                <P>Coming from an illustrious line of public servants well-known for their prompt action and delivery of quality service, City Vice Mayor Jan Marionne R. Fontelera is a former seminarian, who went on to graduate with a Bachelor of Science in Nursing degree from the Far Eastern University. He is pursuing a Master’s degree in Public Administration, which now complements his career in public service.

                    His humble beginnings in government dates back to his first work as a Job Order under the City Information Office circa 2010. In his search for his niche, he ran for public office and was elected as city councilor in 2013, where he called upon his knowledge and training in health services to pen legislations that promote the welfare of women and children. In 2017, he was appointed by former City Mayor Arthur F. Celeste as one of his executive assistants in charge of matters on sports development, health and sanitation.
                    </P>

                <P>His socio-civic engagement is highlighted by his active membership in the JCI Hundred Islands, where he served as President in 2017. Under his leadership, the organization was awarded the Platinum Seal of Excellence, ranking 13th best JCI local organization all over the Philippines.</P>
                <P>During the May 2022 elections, he was the resounding choice of Alaminians when he was elected City Vice Mayor for the term 2022-2025—making his family proud that he is continuing the legacy of the Action Man, former Mayor Dong Fontelera, and building on the efforts of his father, Councilor Jojo Fontelera. He is currently a Board of Director of the Vice Mayor’s League of the Philippines – Pangasinan Chapter, and the auditor of VMLP Region 1.</P>   
                 <P>For someone so young, he wears a lot of hats: an entrepreneur, a bike enthusiast, a protective brother, a loving husband to Xyranne, a nurturing father to Primo, a dedicated public servant to the City of Alaminos.</P>
